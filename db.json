Although a lot of the playground equipment is best for ages 3 and up, this park truly is one of Missoula’s best kept secrets. It is rarely busy and located at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac. The street is easy to miss, but watch for Lafray Lane off of River Road. This park also features a covered patio area with picnic tables and a port-a-potty (hey, its better than nothing!)",
